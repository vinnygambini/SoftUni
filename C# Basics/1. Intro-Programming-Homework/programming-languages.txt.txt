A recent survey by the online course provider Lynda.com for Mashable produced the following list of languages in order of popularity:

.Java
C
C++
C#
Objective-C
PHP
Python
Ruby
JavaScript
SQL

The usual suspects are there but, again, results will be biased by the topics offered and the site’s target audience (primarily newer developers).

Industry analyst RedMonk has taken a different approach and determined language popularity by examining the frequency of projects on GitHub and questions on StackOverflow:

JavaScript
Java
PHP
C#
Python
C++
Ruby
C
Objective-C
CSS


C# and Java are actually quite similar, from an application developer's perspective.Reference types are very similar to pointers in C++, particularly when setting an identifier to some new class instance. But when accessing the properties or methods of this reference type, use the "." operator, which is similar to accessing data instances in C++ that are created on the stack. All class instances are created on the heap by using the new operator, but delete is not allowed, as both languages use their own garbage collection schemesBoth C# and Java have built-in garbage collection.
